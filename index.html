        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello, my name is Brittney Samaniego and Iâ€™m currently a second year student majoring in Pre-business and concentrating on accounting. I have a gpa of 3.8 unweighted, got 4 consecutive years of principal's honor roll and was considered top 10% of my graduating class. Down below is a glimpse of some of my experiences and some pictures depicting some of my accomplishments throughout the years. I had the privilege to attend the CUE 2018 convention consisting of new types of engineering projects and to design the t-shirts that would be given out to the participants. The following year I decided to embark on the journey of creating a 3D printed prosthetic arm for a 3 year old girl and won second place at the state science fair. <br><br>

        Currently, Iâ€™m involved with a couple clubs including the Latino Business Student Association, ASM Women in Business and Undergraduate Business Students. My experiences with these clubs Iâ€™ve gained more of an understanding with the world of business, marketing, the foundations of what determines a thriving business, and new business connections. For five years, I had the opportunity to join Scripps College Academy which helped me achieve my spot at the University of California Riverside and participate in some stem classes to further my education. Based on my experience, I have explored different aspects of business which furthered my qualifications as a future businesswoman. I was able to understand the needs of a customer, how to create an environment to entice more clients to buy more products, etc. <br><br>

        After spending around a year in the food industry, I decided to focus my attention on being more active with school and had the honor to fill the role as treasurer for the Latino Business Student Association. I learned how to cooperate with others to make business decisions and keep the club organized with assets and orders. Because of having some experience with my internship with UpMerch, I learned how to improve my marketing skills, collaborate closely with a design team, finance team and clients. I was able to improve the attendance of the participants in the club, create exciting new event ideas, and design new merch for several clubs and companies. In the meantime, I am furthering my knowledge with programs like Excel, Microsoft, Photoshop, and Github. Iâ€™m always excited to take upon new challenges and learn opportunities as I recently learned how to make and code my own website!
